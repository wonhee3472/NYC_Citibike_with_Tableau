## Purpose of Analysis
The goal of this project is to present to the investors a data visualization report of bike-sharing service in NYC so that I can help them strategize their plans of starting the same/similar service in Des Moines, Iowa.  

## Results
I was able to create several graphs from the given dataset that demonstrates bike usage trends. To be more precise, I came up with the following graphs posted below.
